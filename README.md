# signup-form

This is the first in the Odin Project's Intermediate CSS module. The prompt asked for a sign up form with specific design parameters. 

For this project, I spent time trying to come up with my own color palettes instead of finding themed ones online and working with CSS's "positioning:" for the floater divs on the left side.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience. After doing some research, I see I need to add JavaScript to the page to have password input boxes be required to match. This is something I will come back to later. Mobile responsiveness is something I need to work on. My next CSS project (and eventually past ones) will be mobile-friendly before the final git push.

I wanted to incorporate more CSS pseudo classes for practice but felt it took away from the overall simplistic look I was going for. So, I left it at hovers for the links and buttons.
