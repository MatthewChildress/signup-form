# signup-form

This is the first in the Odin Project's Intermediate CSS module. The prompt asked for a sign up form with specific design parameters. 

For this project, I spent time trying to come up with my own color palettes instead of finding themed ones online and working with CSS's "positioning:" for the floater divs on the left side.
